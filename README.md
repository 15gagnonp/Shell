# Shell
Rudimentary Reverse Shell using Python 


## How To
First start the serverShell.py on your host.

Then once you have delivered the reverseShell.py to the victim machine run reverseShell.py \<server IP>.

Once this is run you can enter commands on the serverShell.py prompt and it will return the results.

#### Note:
- By default this reverse shell runs over port 8000
- You can change this by simple editing the code in the reverseShell.py on line 5 "Server Port = 8000" before deploying.
